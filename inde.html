    <h1>When the Sun </h1>
    <p> When the sun sets, <br>
        I imagine it tells the moon <em>hello.</em>
    <p>When the sun sets, <br>
        I imagine the oceans waves <em>farewell.</em></p>
    <p>When the sun sets, <br>
        I imagine the stars shine bright enough to replenish the vibrant night sky.
    <p> When the sun sets, <br>
        I imagine the people who stay awake, making wishes on passing shooting stars. </p>
    <p> When the sun sets, <br>
        I imagine children looking at the moon with <em>amazement</em>, dreaming that they're there.</p>
    <p> But when the sun <em>rises,</em> <br>
        I imagine the moon says <strong>"good morning!"</strong></p>
    <p> When the sun rises, <br>
        Parents wake to find their children excited from their adventures in the night. </p>
    <p> When the sun rises, <br>
       animals bask in the warmth of the sun's rays. </p>
    <p> When the sun rises, <br>
        and covers the world in it's eternal light, <br>
        I imagine the sun sighs in content, settles herself in the sky, <br>
        and tells the world <em><strong>hello.</strong></em></p>
